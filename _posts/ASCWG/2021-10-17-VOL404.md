# Note

1 - the main reason for this challenge is to publish this write up. 

2 - in a real case of a memory corrupted memory dump, you will need to fix the dump then you can analyse it, if you follow this solution in a real case you will not solve it because the pointers will point to invalid locations but here I edited the memory.

3 - the main technical reason for this challenge is to know how to walk throw a memory without volatility, imagine having a case with a new Windows version that has a new data structure struct (thread, process, file, .., etc), will you wait for volatility update ??
